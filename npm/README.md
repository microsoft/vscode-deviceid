## Install

## Development

Configure your environment for node-gyp. [Instructions for Windows are here.](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows)
In addition to the basic C++ workload, you'll need the x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated Libs

To validate the native build, the simplest way is to install the package.

- Create a temporary directory
- In it, run `npm i c:\full\path\to\this\repo`
- This will fully install the package including running the node-gyp build
